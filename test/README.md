Here's an improved version of your README file that includes instructions for running Terraform plans for the entire configuration as well as specific modules with dynamic variables:

## **Module Testing**

Use this folder to run local testing of the modules.

### **Setup**

1. **Navigate to the GCP Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd gcp
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

   Initialize the Terraform working directory. This step downloads the necessary provider plugins.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Validate Configuration:**

   Validate the Terraform files to ensure the configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent.

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

### **Run Terraform Plan**

#### **Whole Plan**

To generate an execution plan for the entire configuration, run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

#### **Specific Modules**

To generate an execution plan targeting a specific module, use the `-target` option along with dynamic variable values:

```bash
terraform plan --target="module.cloud-cloudbuild-trigger" -var "gcp_project=infra-dev-migue-93b99628" -var "gcp_region=europe-west2"
```

### **Notes**

- Ensure that the `gcp_project` and `gcp_region` variables are set appropriately for your environment. These can be passed directly in the command line as shown above, or set in a `terraform.tfvars` file.
- If all validations and plans are successful, the configuration is ready to be applied.

### **Future Improvements**

- **CI Integration:** Plan to integrate this process into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automatically build and test the module examples in a dedicated project environment.
