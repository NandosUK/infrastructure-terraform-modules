# Google Cloud Build Trigger Terraform Module

This module creates a Google Cloud Build Trigger, allowing you to automatically run builds on source code changes. The trigger can be configured to listen for changes on specific branches, include or exclude specific files, and apply custom substitutions during the build.

## Usage

```hcl
module "trigger_main" {
  source            = "github.com/NandosUK/infrastructure-terraform-modules//gcp/cloud-build-trigger-v1"
  name              = "my-trigger"
  description       = "A sample Google Cloud Build Trigger."
  repository_owner  = "NandosUK"
  repository_name   = "my-repo"
  branch            = "main"
  invert_regex      = false
  substitutions     = {
    _LOCATION = "europe-west2"
  }
  include           = ["**"]
  exclude           = []
  disabled          = false
  tags              = ["example-tag"]
}
```
